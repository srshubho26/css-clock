# CSS Clock

You may wounder what is great about this clock. May be this type of clock can be made very easily using JavaScript Date object and setInteval function. But there is no JavaScript of other programming language used in this project. This project is buit with pure HTML and CSS. I did it for experiment purpose. CSS animation is the main thing here. The time is static here as time can't be accessed using css. But it works like a real clock.
