# CSS Clock

You may wonder what is great about this clock. May be this type of clock can be made very easily using JavaScript 'Date' object and 'setInteval' function.

But there is no JavaScript or other programming language used in this project. This project is built using pure HTML and CSS.

I did it as an experiment. CSS animation is the main thing here. The time is static here as real time can't be accessed using CSS. But it works like a real clock.
